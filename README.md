karma-requirejs-mock
====================

A Karma.js test framework setup with Require.js and a simple mocking system for isolating modules from their dependencies.

## Requirements

You will need Node installed. 

## Instructions

Once node is installed, just run `npm install` and it should fetch all the dependencies. 

Karma.js is installed as a local module, so you will need to run it explicitly from the node\_modules folder. There is a shell script you can use for this on Linux/Mac. Just follow these steps:

 1. Open a terminal
 2. Navigate to the `test` folder
 3. Run `./karma.start`
